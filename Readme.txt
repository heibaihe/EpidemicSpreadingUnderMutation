Simulation codes (in C language) accompanying the paper entitled "Epidemic spreading under mutually independent
intra- and inter-host pathogen evolution" published in XXXX.

All codes are listed as follows:

PhaseDiagramSIR_alpha: Producing figures for alpha-mutation for SIR dynamics, i.e.,  Fig. 2 (all panels), Fig3 (panels a, b and c) in the main text, and Fig 4a in supplementary information.

PhaseDiagramSIS_alpha: Producing figures for alpha-mutation for SIS dynamics, i.e.,  Fig 2 (all panels) and Fig 5a in supplementary information.

PhaseDiagramSIR_beta: Producing figures for beta-mutation for SIR dynamics, i.e.,  Fig 3 (all panels) and Fig 4b in supplementary information.

PhaseDiagramSIS_beta: Producing figures for beta-mutation for SIS dynamics, i.e.,  Fig 5b in supplementary information.

TimingMitigation: Producing figure for the test of mitigation timing, i.e. Fig 4 in the main text.

ReemergenceImmunity Evasion: Producing figure for reemergence due to immunity evasion, i.e. Fig 5 in the main text.

TestForSigma: Producing figure for the test of influence of intra-host mutation on observed sigma, i.e. Fig 6 in supplementary information.

Notes: As a rule, variable names are identical in the paper and the code. Variables not appearing in the paper are documneted in comment in their first instance.
